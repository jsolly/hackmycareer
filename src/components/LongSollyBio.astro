                    As a highly skilled geospatial software engineer, I have a
                    wealth of experience blending GIS domain knowledge with
                    full-stack development to create stunning and efficient
                    mapping applications. My academic background includes a
                    bachelor's degree in Geography from UCSB, where I had the
                    privilege of studying under renowned thought leaders Michael
                    Goodchild and Waldo Tobler. I further honed my skills with
                    an M.S. in Geoinformatics and Geospatial Intelligence at
                    George Mason University. After graduation, I played a
                    pivotal role in launching one of the world's most viewed
                    geospatial web applications, <a

                    After Esri, I spent a year as an Integration Consultant at a
                    business intelligence startup called YellowfinBI which was
                    aquired by Idera Inc. in 2022. I left Yellowfin after the
                    aquisition to work on this blog while also rasing my son,
                    Justice Solly, who was born 2/20/22. Six months later, I
                    joined University of Maryland as a senior geospatial
                    developer for the <a

                    enables efficient, accessible, and sustainable onloading,
                    analysis, and extraction of large geospatial datasets into
                    blockchain-managed decentralized storage systems such as
