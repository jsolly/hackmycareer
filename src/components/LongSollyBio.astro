    As a highly skilled geospatial software engineer, I have a wealth of
    experience blending GIS domain knowledge with full-stack development to
    create stunning and efficient mapping applications. My academic background
    includes a bachelor's degree in Geography from UCSB, where I had the
    privilege of studying under renowned thought leaders Michael Goodchild and
    Waldo Tobler. I further honed my skills with an M.S. in Geoinformatics and
    Geospatial Intelligence at George Mason University. After graduation, I
    played a pivotal role in launching one of the world's most viewed geospatial
    web applications, <a

    >, as a product engineer at Esri.

    After Esri, I spent a year as an Integration Consultant at a business
    intelligence startup called YellowfinBI which was aquired by Idera Inc. in
    2022. I left Yellowfin after the aquisition to work on this blog while also
    rasing my son, Justice Solly, who was born 2/20/22. Six months later, I
    joined University of Maryland as a senior geospatial developer for the <a

        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">EASIER Data Initiative</a
    >, a UMD project in collaboration with the <a
        href="https://ffdweb.org/"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">Filecoin Foundation For the Decentralied Web</a
    >. I was responsible for developing infrastructure that enables efficient,
    accessible, and sustainable onloading, analysis, and extraction of large
    geospatial datasets into blockchain-managed decentralized storage systems
    such as Filecoin and IPFS.

    In Fall 2023, I joined <a
        href="https://www.newlighttechnologies.com/"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">NLT</a
    > as a senior software engineer, contributing to some of NLT's largest and most
    influential projects. I'm now part of a multi-year effort for the <a
        href="https://www.census.gov/"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">US Census</a
    >
    to develop a web-based geospatial application for the Census Enterprise Dissemination
    Services and Consumer Innovation (CEDSCI) division.
