## Relevant Projects

### U.S. Government Spending Application
- This serverless Vue.js dashboard application, currently used by NOAA and the U.S. Census Bureau, is crafted to empower non-technical decision-makers. It streamlines the analysis and interpretation of intricate financial and demographic data, significantly enhancing decision-making efficiency. Its intuitive interface and real-time integration have markedly improved transparency and accountability in governmental fiscal management.

### Web3 Geospatial Dashboard
- [Web3-geo-dashboard](https://github.com/easierdata/web3-geo-dashboard) is a revolutionary web3 mapping application that provides an intuitive 'at a glance' view of geospatial data stored in Filecoin deals. This platform is engineered with a multi-tiered storage solution, utilizing Hot (Amazon S3), Warm (IPFS), and Cold (Filecoin) data storage layers to serve data efficiently and cost-effectively.
- Users can easily access, analyze, and download diverse datasets, with the added capability to securely conduct imagery transactions using integrated crypto wallet features.

### Vietnam Low Carbon Emissions Planner
- A serverless application deployed on Amazon services using Terraform, I was crucial in developing dynamic model output functionality and building the Energy Efficient Retrofits page. Working alongside three developers, I focused on transforming complex Excel data into an engaging, interactive web platform. This significantly enhanced user interaction and understanding, effectively visualizing Vietnam's strategies for carbon emission reduction.

### IPFS-stac
- Wrote 45% of the code for [ipfs-stac](https://pypi.org/project/ipfs-stac/), a Python package that seamlessly integrates STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This integration facilitates interaction with IPFS assets stored on STAC servers through native Python objects, enhancing accessibility and usability of geospatial data within the web3 ecosystem.
